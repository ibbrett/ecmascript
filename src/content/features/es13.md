  - <a href="https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_regexps.html#reg-exp-flags" target="_blank">flag support</a>: /d (hasIndices) - provides start and end indices for matched substrings
- introduced top-level await, allowing the keyword to be used at the top level of modules
- new class elements: public and private instance fields, public and private static fields, private instance methods and accessors, and private static methods and accessors; static blocks inside classes, to perform per-class evaluation initialization; 
- the #x in obj syntax, to test for presence of private fields on objects
- the cause property on Error objects, which can be used to record a causation chain in errors
- the <i>at</i> method for Strings, Arrays, and TypedArrays, which allows relative indexing
  - [Array.prototype.at()](../../Array/at/): foo
- Object.property.hasOwn(), a convenient alternative to Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()
