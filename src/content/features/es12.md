- String.prototype.replaceAll()
- Promise.any()
  - a promise combinator that short-circuits when an input value is fulfilled
- AggregateError()
  - a new error type to represent multiple errors at once
- logical assignment operators (??=, &&=, ||=)
- WeakRef, for referring to a target object without preserving it from garbage collection
- FinalizationRegistry, to manage registration and unregistration of cleanup operations performed when target objects are garbage collected
- separators for numeric literals (1_000)
- Array.prototype.sort was made more precise, reducing the number of cases that result in an implementation-defined sort order.
