- introduced a BigInt primitive type for arbitrary-sized integers, 
- Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)
  - provides a convenient way to handle null or undefined values
- Optional Chaining Operator (?.)
  - allows you to safely access the properties and methods of an object without worrying about potential null or undefined values.
- the global This object

```bash
BigInts are created either with the BigInt constructor or with the syntax 10n, where "n" is placed after the number literal. BigInts allow the representation and manipulation of integers beyond Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, while Numbers are represented by a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 value. The built-in functions in Math are not compatible with BigInts; for example, exponentiation of BigInts must be done with the ** operator instead of Math.pow.

The nullish coalescing operator, ??, returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side is null or undefined. This contrasts with the || operator, which would return "string" for all "falsy" values, such as the ones below.

undefined ?? "string" // -> "string"
null ?? "string" // -> "string"
false ?? "string" // -> false
NaN ?? "string" // -> NaN
Optional chaining makes it possible to access the nested properties of an object without having an AND check at each level. An example is const zipcode = person?.address?.zipcode. If any of the properties are not present, zipcode will be undefined.
```
