```js
// combining the logical operations(&&, || or ??) with assignment(=).

// Logical nullish assignment (??=)
// Logical nullish assignment operator assigns a value to a variable if it is currently nullish (undefined or null)
let currentUserId;
currentUserId ??= 42;
console.log(currentUserId);
// Expected Output: 42

// Logical AND assignment (&&=)
// Logical AND assignment operator assigns a value to a variable if it is currently truthy.
let user = {id: 42, name: "Brett"};
user &&= {...user, admin: true};
console.log(user);
// Expected Output: {id: 42, name: 'Brett', admin: true}

// Logical OR assignment (||=)
// Logical OR assignment operation assigns a value to a variable if it is currently falsy.
let authenticatedUser = {id: 42, name: "Brett"};
authenticatedUser.admin ||= true;
console.log(authenticatedUser);
// Expected Output: {id: 42, name: 'Brett', admin: true}
```

```js
// ES12 ECMAScript 2021 - introduced ReplaceAll
const p = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?';
console.log(p.replaceAll('dog', 'monkey'));
// Expected output: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy monkey. If the monkey reacted, was it really lazy?"
// Global flag required when calling replaceAll with regex

const regex = /Dog/gi;
console.log(p.replaceAll(regex, 'ferret'));
// Expected output: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy ferret. If the ferret reacted, was it really lazy?"

console.log(p.replace(regex, 'ferret'));
// Expected output: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy ferret. If the ferret reacted, was it really lazy?"
// Global flag required when calling replaceAll with regex

const regex2 = /Dog/i;
console.log(p.replaceAll(regex2, 'ferret'));
// Expected output: Uncaught TypeError: String.prototype.replaceAll called with a non-global RegExp argument

console.log(p.replace(regex2, 'ferret'));
// The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy ferret. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?
