import {frontmatter as IncludesPost} from '../Array/includes.mdx'
import Methods from "../../components/Methods.astro";
export const searchMethodsLabel = "new Array search methods";
export const searchMethods = [
  { name: "includes", desc: IncludesPost.what },
];

- destructuring patterns (of variables)
- proper tail calls 
- exponentiation operator ** for numbers
- await
- async keywords for asynchronous programming (as a preparation for ES2017)
<Methods label={searchMethodsLabel} list={searchMethods} />

```bash
The exponentiation operator is equivalent to Math.pow, but provides a simpler syntax similar to languages like Python, F#, Perl, and Ruby. async / await was hailed as an easier way to use promises and develop asynchronous code.
```
