## Who I am?
My name is Brett Morriss. I'm a Senior Full Stack Engineer specializing in Node and React. I have three decades of experience creating amazing server-side and client-side solutions.

## What do I do?
I love to continue to learn about new technologies, seeing what I can do in the cloud, on the server and for the client. I've built UIs, apps, libraries, API servers, testing tools, databases. 

I've been using Node for 10 years and UIs with Angular, Vue and React. I started to use React 6 years ago on a team writing class-based components and using Redux as a global store. When 16.8 came out I started writing functional components and making use of hooks and Context as an application store. I started out with ReactJS, moved on to React Native, then React NativeBase, and most recently NextJS.

I'm interested in leveraging the power of cloud services and new frameworks like Astro and Qwik. I've use webpack and more recently Vite. I've used many different databases.

## What's my ask?
I'm looking to continue using the most effective technologies to build best-in-class UIs
